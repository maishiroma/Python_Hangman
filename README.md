# Python_Hangman
A simple Python Hangman game.

This was inspired from [this website](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/10/32-hangman.html)
This is a single player game where the game visually keeps track of how many guesses you have left. It also selects a random word from the given text file.
